    <h1>Totaly Help</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Adding a Receipt Group</h2>
    <p>
        When you start up Totaly for the first time, the first thing you'll have to do is add a receipt group.
        A receipt group is simply a collection of receipts. You can add as many receipt groups as you want!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add a receipt group in multiple places:
        <ul>
            <li>In the File menu in the main menu</li>
            <li>The menu at the bottom of the sidebar</li>
            <li>Secondary clicking on an empty part of the sidebar and clicking "Add New Receipt Group"</li>
            <li>Dragging and dropping images onto the sidebar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The video below shows adding a receipt group via the menu at the bottom of the sidebar</p>

    <h3>Adding a New Receipt to an Existing Receipt Group</h3>
    <p>Adding a new receipt to an existing receipt group is the same as adding a receipt group above, just select "Receipt" instead of receipt group.</p>
    <h2>Adding Item Amounts</h2>
    <p>
        After adding a receipt or receipt group, Totaly will have automatically scanned and parsed item amounts. 
        You can now select the items you wish to include in the total. Feel free to also add new items and edit amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take note of the two totals above the item amounts. "This Receipt" is the total amount of selected items of the current receipt,
        "All Receipts" is the total of all selected items across all receipts in the receipt group.
    </p>

    <h2>Splitting Item Amounts and Showing Totals and Tax</h2>
    <p>You can split item amounts per person as well opt to show or hide detected totals and taxes.</p>

    <h2>Renaming Receipts and Receipt Groups</h2>
    <p>
        You can rename receipts and receipt groups by secondary clicking them in the sidebar and clicking "Rename". 
        This is also how you delete receipts and receipt groups.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary Page and Exporting the Summary</h2>
    <p>You can view a summary page of all receipts in the receipt group, as well as export the current receipt group to a JPEG</p>

    <h2>Exporting and Importing Application Data</h2>
    <p>
        You can export and import Totaly application data in case you are switching Macs or installing Totaly on multiple Macs. 
        This also gives you access to the underlying JSON data if you wish to use the data in programmatic ways or as a backup.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be warned that making changes to exported data may make it unusable by Totaly if imported back in, so if you plan on Importing
        the data back into Totaly don't make changes to it! If you plan on tampering with the files or data in the exported application
        make a copy first!
    </p>
